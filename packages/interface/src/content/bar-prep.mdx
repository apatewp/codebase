The Bar Exam is a(n) (un)necessary part of being qualified to be an attorney.
We feel that what the bar exam tests, isn't representative of the real
practice of law, because a lot of what the bar tests is rote learning based
on memorizing a lot of stuff we could easily Google. Additionally, we learn and
advocate best while working in a group, and the bar exam creates an artificial
experience that somebody is all alone. We support diploma privilege, or
giving anyone who graduated from an ABA-accredited law school, automatic
membership to the Bar, because the conditions of the bar exam are so far
removed from real life.

Nonetheless, we have open-sourced our approach to passing the bar exam, and
the following flashcards are how we have practice "rule slapdowns", or writing
out rule statements over and over again so that they are ingrained in our
muscle memory.

We recommend the following approach to bar-prep.

1. Read the book [Fck the Bar](https://www.fckthebar.com), this has been the
  most helpful bar-prep advice book. It's half prep-talk, half practical
  advice, and it's short enough you can get through it one sitting.
2. Start doing practice problems. In California, the last few years of bar
  exams are [available
  here](http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Admissions/Examinations/California-Bar-Examination/Past-Exams).
  Nothing will supplant or come anywhere close to studying by practicing.
3. Practice our rule slapdowns via our [flashcards](/bar-prep/flashcards)
  app. This was not recommended by the Fck the Bar book, but it's something we
  find helpful, because we feel that memorizing the rules is the hardest part
  to bar prep. Our flashcards are more of blocks, because each flashcard
  contains multiple topics that are commonly tested together. By memorizing and
  reciting cues as blocks, we have a better chance of "getting points" from
  the examiners.
